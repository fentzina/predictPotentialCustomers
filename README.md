# predictPotentialCustomers
This project discusses Classification and Hypothesis Testing and involves identifying which leads are more likely to convert to paid customers based on attributes of leads and their interaction details.
The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model. Click on the link below to download the dataset I used for this project: ***

### **Objective:**

Imagine that you are a Data Science Manager at Amazon, and you have been given the task of building a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. You have a collection of labeled data of Amazon reviews of products. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from the data and build a recommendation system that helps in recommending products to online consumers.

### **Dataset:**

The Amazon dataset contains the following attributes:
- **userId:** Every user identified with a unique id
- **productId:** Every product identified with a unique id
- **Rating:** The rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user
- **timestamp:** Time of the rating. We **will not use this column** to solve the current problem
